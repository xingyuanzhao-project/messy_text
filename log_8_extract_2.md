### done
a small prototype for concept proving

### issue
my model is too small, may not be able to do the job.
need the desc text of the labels
find a way to identify and record 404 or no information found
do i need label by label or col by col summary?

any plans for the validation? human validation?

### explanation
dumb luck thing: n is big enough

### todo
get the super messy ones, and make sure no false positive, (negative example)
2 stage prompt:
st1: sum
st2: clas
zero shots/few shots

maybe create label wise sum?

what models?
keep prompt eng
use smaller models to tune prompts, then scale up
show snap shots
